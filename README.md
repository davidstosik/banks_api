# Banks API

## Project

### Classes

#### `Bank` (unnecessary?)

Specific bank classes (eg. `ShinseiBank`) inherit from this. (Maybe using
duck-typing is enough?)

#### `UserAccount`

This represents a user account in a specific bank, with its credentials.

```rb
attr_accessor :bank           # Class? Symbol?
attr_accessor :credentials    # Hash? CredentialSet?
has_many :bank_accounts, class_name: "BankAccount"
```

#### `BankAccount`

A bank account that has a balance and a list of transactions.
(There may be multiple bank accounts in a unique user account.)

```rb
attr_accessor :name           # String
attr_accessor :balance        # Money?
has_many :transactions, class_name: "Transaction"
```

#### `Transaction`

A credit or a debit transaction, with an amount, a date and a description.
(How about a payee, only on the YNAB side?)

```rb
attr_accessor :type           # Symbol? (:credit, :debit)
attr_accessor :amount         # Money?
attr_accessor :description    # String
attr_accessor :date           # Date
```
